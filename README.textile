h2. *RailsBike* CMS framework

This is an attempt to create a *simple* and convenient framework for content management.

We explored several frameworks and took from them the best.

In particular, many thanks to "Spree":http://spreecommerce.com/ for:

* ThemeSupport (hooks)
* Config pattern

We also use *Rails 3.1* (extensions based on *Rails Engines*), *CoffeScript*, *Compas* and other features
